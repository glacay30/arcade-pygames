# Introduction
This is where I will store my Python Games, updating it as I make more.

The basic guide here is to only look at folders named after games. They will each have their own resources, like images
and stuff, but nothing complicated.
## Made with:
* [Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyGame](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame) *I use pygame-1.9.2b1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64*
* [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

### Done:
* Pong
* Slither

### Current:
* Tetris

### Future:
