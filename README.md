# Introduction
This is where I will store my Python Games, updating it as I make more.

The basic guide here is to only look at folders named after games. They will each have their own resources, like images
and stuff, but nothing complicated.

## Made with:
* [Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyGame](http://pygame.org/download.shtml)
* [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)


### Done:
* Pong
* Slither

### Current:
* Tetris

### Future:
* Solitaire
* Basic platformer
